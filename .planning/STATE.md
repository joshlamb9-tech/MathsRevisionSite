## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-planning]: GitHub Pages (static) — matches French site, zero hosting cost
- [Pre-planning]: KaTeX over MathJax — faster render, smaller bundle, sufficient for CE-level maths
- [Pre-planning]: localStorage for RAG tracker — no backend, works offline, GDPR-friendly
- [Pre-planning]: .nojekyll required — prevents Jekyll from mangling prime notation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Desmos production API key** — request from info@desmos.com early, before Phase 3. Demo key works for dev but production key needed before go-live.
- **10 missing Core topics** — Maths teacher input required before Phase 3. Content must be scoped before 03-02 through 03-04 are planned.
- **Offline use decision** — if site must work on school laptops with no internet, KaTeX must be self-hosted and Desmos cannot be embedded. Resolve in Phase 1.
