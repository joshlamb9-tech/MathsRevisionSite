      - "04-01-SUMMARY.md and 04-02-SUMMARY.md use non-standard frontmatter (provides field instead of requirements-completed) — gsd summary-extract cannot auto-read Phase 4 requirements from SUMMARY frontmatter."

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------------|--------|-------|
| 1: Scaffold and Foundation | Present | human_needed | All automated checks pass; 4 browser/visual items pending Josh confirmation |
| 2: Foundation Content | **MISSING** ⚠ | unverified | Both SUMMARYs self-check passed; all FND requirements confirmed in REQUIREMENTS.md |
| 3: Core Content | Present | passed | 5/5 truths verified; 2 Desmos interaction items pending human browser check |
| 4: Additional Content | Present | passed | 12/12 must-haves verified; 3 browser checks pending |

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result: 5/5 E2E flows complete. 0 broken flows. 0 orphaned exports.**

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Homepage → Foundation level → Fractions → worked example | COMPLETE | All links wired; KaTeX, non-calc badge, breadcrumb present |
| Core index → Coordinates/Graphs → Desmos → mobile scroll | COMPLETE | API script, wrapper, overlay, toggle all wired |
| Additional index → Pythagoras → worked example → Desmos | COMPLETE | Fully wired; cosmetic button colour mismatch only |
| Any topic → breadcrumb back to level → nav to other levels | COMPLETE | 24/24 topic pages wired correctly |
| KaTeX renders on all content pages | COMPLETE | Identical head block on all 25 topic pages; $$ before $ confirmed |

### Integration Issues Found

**1. Desmos toggle button colour mismatch on Pythagoras page (cosmetic)**
- File: `assets/css/styles.css` — `.desmos-toggle-btn { background: var(--core-accent) }` is global
- Effect: toggle button on `additional/pythagoras/index.html` renders blue instead of purple
- Severity: Cosmetic — button functions correctly; GRAPH-04 satisfied
- Fix: Add `.additional .desmos-toggle-btn { background: var(--additional-accent); }` to styles.css, OR add `id="additional"` to the body/main and scope accordingly

**2. Non-calculator badge inline style not formalised (maintainability)**
- All 6 Foundation pages carry an identical inline `style=` attribute for the non-calc badge
- No `.non-calc-badge` CSS class exists in styles.css
- Severity: Maintainability only — no display bug; FND-01 through FND-06 satisfied
- Fix: Add `.non-calc-badge` to styles.css and replace inline styles across 6 files

## Tech Debt Summary

| # | Item | Phase | Severity | Fix |
|---|------|-------|----------|-----|
| 1 | INFRA-04 and DESIGN-04 unchecked in REQUIREMENTS.md | Phase 1 | Minor — doc | Tick checkboxes |
| 2 | Phase 2 missing VERIFICATION.md | Phase 2 | Minor — process | Run gsd-verifier on Phase 2 |
| 3 | desmos-toggle-btn blue on Pythagoras page | Phase 4 | Cosmetic | CSS scope override |
| 4 | Non-calc badge inline style on 6 Foundation pages | Phase 2 | Maintainability | Extract to CSS class |
| 5 | CSS colour placeholders (--mh-navy, --mh-gold) | Phase 1 | Action required | Josh to confirm colours |
| 6 | Desmos demo API key on 4 pages | Phases 3–4 | Go-live blocker | Request production key |
| 7 | Phase 4 plan checkboxes show [ ] in ROADMAP.md | Phase 4 | Minor — doc | Update to [x] |
| 8 | Phase 4 SUMMARY uses non-standard frontmatter | Phase 4 | Minor — tooling | Rename `provides` to `requirements-completed` |

**Total: 8 items. 0 critical blockers. 1 go-live blocker (Desmos API key — was already tracked).**

## Human Verification Outstanding (Browser Required)

Across all three phase VERIFICATION.md files, these items require a real browser before go-live:

1. **Colour scheme** — Confirm navy header and gold nav highlight match Mowden Hall brand
2. **Mobile layout** — No horizontal scroll at 375px viewport (overflow-x: hidden confirmed in code)
3. **KaTeX rendering on live URL** — Visit https://joshlamb9-tech.github.io/MathsRevisionSite/katex-test/ and confirm all 6 sections render
4. **Navigation from topic stubs on live URL** — Breadcrumb and nav links resolve correctly end-to-end
5. **Desmos graphs load** — All 4 Desmos pages load the interactive graph from CDN
6. **Mobile Desmos scroll toggle** — Toggle button switches scroll and interact modes on touch device

---

## Go-Live Checklist

Before publishing to pupils:

- [ ] Josh confirms `--mh-navy` and `--mh-gold` colours match Mowden Hall brand
- [ ] Desmos production API key obtained and replaced in all 4 pages (`coordinates-graphs`, `transformations`, `straight-line-graphs`, `pythagoras`)
- [ ] Browser smoke-test: KaTeX renders on live URL, Desmos graphs load, navigation works
- [ ] Phase 5 (RAG tracker + formula sheets) complete
