<objective>
Author two Additional-level topic pages — Index Laws and Expanding/Factorising — by replacing the placeholder content in each existing stub with fully worked KaTeX content.

Purpose: Completes ADD-01 and ADD-02, giving pupils access to worked examples for the two non-graphing Additional topics.
Output: Two complete HTML topic pages ready to deploy.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Author Index Laws page (ADD-01)</name>
  <files>additional/index-laws/index.html</files>
  <action>
    Replace the placeholder paragraph in `additional/index-laws/index.html` with fully authored content. Keep everything in the existing `<head>` and `<header>` blocks exactly as-is — only replace the `<main>` block content starting after the opening `<main class="main-content">` tag.

    Structure to implement inside `<main>`:

    1. Breadcrumb:
       ```html
       <p class="breadcrumb">
         <a href="/MathsRevisionSite/">Home</a> &rsaquo;
         <a href="/MathsRevisionSite/additional/">Additional</a> &rsaquo;
         Index Laws
       </p>
       ```

    2. Level badge and heading:
       ```html
       <span class="level-badge additional">Additional</span>
       <h1 class="page-title">Index Laws</h1>
       ```
       DO NOT add a non-calculator badge — Additional = Calculator (Paper 2).

    3. Key Facts section with all five laws as display equations:
       - Multiplication: $$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$$ — state "bases must be the same"
       - Division: $$a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$$
       - Power of a power: $$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$$
       - Zero index: $a^0 = 1$ for any non-zero $a$ (inline)
       - Negative index: $$a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}$$

    4. Worked Example 1: "Simplify $5^3 \times 5^4$ and $\dfrac{2^7}{2^3}$"
       - Step 1: Apply multiplication law — same base, add powers: $5^3 \times 5^4 = 5^{3+4} = 5^7$
       - Step 2: Apply division law — same base, subtract powers: $\dfrac{2^7}{2^3} = 2^{7-3} = 2^4 = 16$
       - Answer: $5^7$ and $16$

    5. Worked Example 2: "Simplify $(3^2)^4$. Evaluate $7^0$ and write $3^{-2}$ as a fraction."
       - Step 1: Power of a power — multiply indices: $(3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \times 4} = 3^8$
       - Step 2: Zero index rule: $7^0 = 1$
       - Step 3: Negative index rule: $3^{-2} = \dfrac{1}{3^2} = \dfrac{1}{9}$
       - Answer: $3^8$, $1$, and $\dfrac{1}{9}$

    Critical checks:
    - Never combine different bases in the same index law expression (e.g., never $2^3 \times 3^4$ under one law)
    - Verify the nav `active` class is on the `Additional` link, NOT `Core` — the stub should already be correct, but confirm before saving

  <action>
    Replace the placeholder paragraph in `additional/expanding-factorising/index.html` with fully authored content. Keep everything in the existing `<head>` and `<header>` blocks exactly as-is — only replace the `<main>` block content.

    Structure to implement inside `<main>`:

         Expanding and Factorising
       </p>
       ```

    2. Level badge and heading:
       ```html
       <span class="level-badge additional">Additional</span>
       <h1 class="page-title">Expanding and Factorising</h1>
       ```
       DO NOT add a non-calculator badge.

    3. Key Facts section:
       - Expanding double brackets: $(x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$ — introduce FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last)
       - Factorising $x^2 + bx + c$: find two numbers that multiply to $c$ and add to $b$
       - Difference of two squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$ — include as a one-line Key Fact with example $x^2 - 9 = (x+3)(x-3)$

    4. Worked Example 1: "Expand $(x + 3)(x - 2)$" using FOIL steps:
       - First: $x \times x = x^2$
       - Outer: $x \times (-2) = -2x$
       - Inner: $3 \times x = 3x$
       - Last: $3 \times (-2) = -6$
       - Collect like terms: $$x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6 = x^2 + x - 6$$
       - Answer: $x^2 + x - 6$

    5. Worked Example 2: "Factorise $x^2 + 5x + 6$"
       - Step 1: Find two numbers that multiply to $6$ and add to $5$. Pairs of factors of 6: $(1, 6)$ and $(2, 3)$. The pair $2$ and $3$ works: $2 \times 3 = 6$ and $2 + 3 = 5$.
       - Step 2: Write the factorised form: $(x + 2)(x + 3)$
       - Step 3: Check by expanding (show FOIL steps): $(x+2)(x+3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6$ ✓
       - Answer: $(x + 2)(x + 3)$

    Critical checks:
    - Always track signs carefully — use negative signs explicitly in worked examples
    - Always show the expand-and-check step in Worked Example 2 so pupils can verify their own factorising
    - Confirm nav `active` class is on `Additional`
