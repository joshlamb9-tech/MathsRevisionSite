# Phase 4.1 Plan 02: Phase 2 Formal Verification Report Summary

**Retrospective audit confirming all 6 Foundation topic pages and all 7 FND requirements (FND-01 through FND-07) are satisfied, closing the only completed phase missing a VERIFICATION.md**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-27T08:57:56Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-27T09:01:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Inspected all 6 Foundation HTML files on disk, confirmed existence, line counts, non-calc badges, Foundation level badges, and breadcrumb links
- Wrote `02-VERIFICATION.md` with YAML status: passed, 4/4 observable truths verified, all 7 FND requirements documented as SATISFIED
- Documented anti-pattern (inline badge style on 5 of 6 pages) as info-severity — known item scheduled for 04.1-01
- Documented 2 human verification items: KaTeX rendering and non-calc badge visual appearance
- Phase 2 now has full documentation parity with Phases 1, 3, and 4

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Write Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md based on SUMMARYs and file inspection** - `0fdd3c1` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/phases/02-foundation-content/02-VERIFICATION.md` — Formal Phase 2 verification report: 4/4 truths verified, 7/7 FND requirements SATISFIED, 6/6 Foundation artifacts listed, 2 human verification items documented

## Decisions Made

- Non-calc badge accepted in both forms as satisfying FND-07 — fractions uses `class="non-calc-badge"` (from 04.1-01 or earlier), the other 5 use equivalent inline-styled `<p>`. Both produce the same visual result and both satisfy the requirement.
- Line counts taken from actual files via `wc -l` rather than SUMMARY estimates — fractions: 107, division: 101, prime-factors: 110, estimation: 100, long-multiplication: 128, averages: 123.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. All facts verified against disk as instructed. The variation in non-calc badge implementation (class vs inline) was already documented in STATE.md decisions from Phase 2.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 2 documentation is now complete and aligned with all other phases
- All FND requirements confirmed satisfied — Phase 5 RAG tracker can safely map to all 6 Foundation topic slugs
- No blockers introduced
