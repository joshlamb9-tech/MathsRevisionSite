<objective>
Generate the missing Phase 2 formal verification report. Phase 2 (Foundation Content) was completed on 2026-02-26 and both SUMMARYs self-check passed, but no VERIFICATION.md was ever written. This plan closes that gap.

Purpose: Audit completeness — Phase 2 is the only completed phase without a formal verification document. Aligns Phase 2 with Phase 1, 3, and 4 which all have VERIFICATION.md files.
Output: .planning/phases/02-foundation-content/02-VERIFICATION.md with status: passed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md based on SUMMARYs and file inspection</name>
  <files>
    .planning/phases/02-foundation-content/02-VERIFICATION.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Phase 2 has two SUMMARYs confirming completion and REQUIREMENTS.md marks all FND requirements [x]. The task is to write the formal verification document that confirms this evidence in the standard format (matching the style of 03-VERIFICATION.md).

    Before writing, verify the following facts against the actual files on disk (use bash/grep as needed):

    1. Confirm all 6 Foundation files exist:
       - foundation/fractions/index.html
       - foundation/division/index.html
       - foundation/prime-factors/index.html
       - foundation/estimation/index.html
       - foundation/long-multiplication/index.html
       - foundation/averages/index.html

    2. Confirm all 6 pages have the non-calc badge (at this point, after 04.1-01 runs, this will be via class="non-calc-badge" — if running in parallel before 04.1-01, it may still be an inline style; either form satisfies FND-07)

    3. Confirm all 6 pages have `class="level-badge foundation"` (Foundation level badge)

    4. Confirm all 6 pages have breadcrumb linking to /MathsRevisionSite/foundation/

    5. Confirm no Foundation page has a calculator badge or Core/Additional level badge

    Then write .planning/phases/02-foundation-content/02-VERIFICATION.md with this structure:

    YAML frontmatter:
    - phase: 02-foundation-content
    - verified: (today's date — use 2026-02-27T00:00:00Z for consistency with audit date)
    - status: passed
    - score: 4/4 success criteria verified
    - re_verification: null
    - gaps: []
    - human_verification: (list KaTeX rendering and non-calc badge visual check as human-only items)

    Body sections to include:
    1. Phase Goal (from ROADMAP.md Phase 2 goal)
    2. Goal Achievement — Observable Truths table (4 truths from Phase 2 success criteria in ROADMAP)
    3. Required Artifacts table (list all 6 Foundation files with line counts from SUMMARYs)
    4. Key Link Verification table (breadcrumbs, KaTeX onload, non-calc badge)
    5. Requirements Coverage table (FND-01 through FND-07, sourced from SUMMARY frontmatter)
    6. Anti-Patterns Found (inline badge style — either note it as resolved by 04.1-01, or note it as a known maintainability item if running this plan in parallel)
    7. Human Verification Required section
    8. Gaps Summary (no gaps — all 7 FND requirements satisfied)

    Use these truth statements (from ROADMAP.md Phase 2 success criteria):
    - Truth 1: "Pupil can navigate to the Foundation index and see all 6 topics listed" — verified by foundation/index.html
    - Truth 2: "Pupil can open each Foundation topic page and read a worked example with correctly rendered equations" — verified by all 6 pages having h2 "Worked Example" sections with KaTeX
    - Truth 3: "Every Foundation topic page displays a non-calculator label (Paper 1)" — verified by badge presence on all 6
    - Truth 4: "Pupil can return to the Foundation index from any topic page via breadcrumb or back-link" — verified by breadcrumb href="/MathsRevisionSite/foundation/" on all 6

    For human verification, list:
    - KaTeX equation rendering — cannot verify without a browser (deferred scripts, client-side render)
    - Non-calculator badge visual appearance — confirm green badge displays correctly

    Line count data from SUMMARYs:
    - fractions/index.html: 107 lines (from 02-01 SUMMARY notes file exists + content described)
    - division/index.html: created in 02-01
    - prime-factors/index.html: created in 02-01
    - estimation/index.html: created in 02-02 (115+ lines — met 120-line min with "Which Average" section on averages)
    - long-multiplication/index.html: created in 02-02
    - averages/index.html: created in 02-02

    Note: Exact line counts should be obtained by reading/counting the actual files, not estimated. If line counts cannot be confirmed precisely, write "verified present" in the Lines column and note that exact line counts were not audited.

    Write the file using the Write tool.
